TODO LIST

Necessary improvements

* MainView: progress report when loading (repos, followers, following)


Feature areas

* Repository: news, code, commits (possibly also issues) [use Pivot]
* Navigate to user: MainView with navigation parameter for login

----

go to commit, go back - no longer on commits page --> page state is necessary (and it reloads)
