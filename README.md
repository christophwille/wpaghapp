## Reporting Bugs, Requesting Features

Send an email to [me](mailto:christoph.wille@gmail.com). Attach a screenshot ([Start + Power button](http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/how-to/wp8/photos/take-a-screenshot))
if you think that will help me track down a bug quicker, or if that includes information you do not want to type out. 

## Features

* `Authorization` - uses OAuth (the main driver for me to implement my own WPA for GitHub)
* `User` - show own repositories, followers and following (private news seems to be impossible via OAuth)

The plan is to allow drill-down into repositories (news, code, issues) as well as other users (which then would look like your account).
Currently, no drill-down is possible, only a listing of items.

## Screenshots

Please see the StoreSubmissionAssets folder, it contains screenshots in various sizes.
